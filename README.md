# plastic

The aim of this repository is to make available current and scientifically validated data on plastic in the oceans. These data have been separated into two sub-folders, experimental *in-situ data* (**i-data**) and data obtained through simulation (**simulation**).

**On-going work** : 
- [ ] add current papers in the corresponding folders

*example* for a specific paper (submitted to MPB) addressing the influence of waves: "Influence of waves on the three dimensional distribution of plastic" -> [simulation/waves/Bajon\_2023.pdf](simulation/waves/Bajon\_2023.pdf) and its data in [simulation/waves/data](simulation/waves/data)

## [i-data](https://github.com/raphaelbajon/plastic-progress/i-data)
List of *in situ data* of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.

## [simulation](https://github.com/raphaelbajon/plastic-progress/simulation)
List of simulations of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.
