# plastic-progress

The scientific articles related to plastic in the oceans are varied and it is interesting to group them according to what they deal with in order to better understand the general dynamics of this problem and how to address it. The aim of this repository is to make available current and scientifically validated data on plastic in the oceans. These data have been separated into two sub-folders, experimental *in-situ data* (**[i-data](i-data)**) and data obtained through simulation (**[simulation](simulation)**).

**On-going work** : 
- [ ] add current papers in the corresponding folders

*example* for a specific paper addressing the influence of waves with numerical simulations: Bajon et al., 2023 "Influence of waves on the three dimensional distribution of plastic" in [simulation/waves/Bajon\_2023.pdf](simulation/waves/Bajon\_2023.pdf) and its data in [simulation/waves/data](simulation/waves/data)

## [i-data](i-data)
List of *in situ data* of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.

## [simulation](simulation)
List of simulations of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.
