At the time of the creation of the file, the document is being submitted to MPB. The data to evaluate the conclusion of the paper will be posted here with zenodo (and the corresopnding doi if the paper is accepted) due to the large size of the netcdf files (for both simulations, coupled or not), not allowed on github (> 100 Mb). 

For the moment, please upload the netcdf files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RdyhXvtia7CAJHlTtsI6EBP4YuUf9AcL?usp=sharing).
