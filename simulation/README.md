# Simulation 
In the [simulation](https://github.com/RaphaelBajon/plastic-progress/tree/main/simulation) repository, articles related to numerical simulations will be added. These papers will cover different aspects linked to the presence of plastic in the ocean. 

Indeed, different processes will be discussed in the articles:
- [2D transport](transport-2d)
- [3D transport](transport-3d)
- [Waves](waves)
- [Biofouling](biofouling)
- [Fragmentation](fragmentation)

## [2d transport](transport-2d)

Floating and surface marine debris, at different depth levels (`â‰ˆ` 2d levels), Stokes drift, etc..  

## [3d transport](transport-3d)

3 dimensional dispersion of neutral particle in a global ocean model, etc..

## [Waves](waves)

The paper titled [Influence of waves on the 3D distribution of plastic in the ocean](https://github.com/RaphaelBajon/plastic-progress/tree/main/simulation/waves/Bajon_2023.pdf) is available in the [waves](https://github.com/RaphaelBajon/plastic-progress/tree/main/simulation/waves) folder. For further questions, do not hesitate to ask me.
